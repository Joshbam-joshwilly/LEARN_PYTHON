GUIDES ON HOW TO GO ABOUT IT
USE 1 WHILE LOOP AND  3 FOR LOOPS

# 4 SPACES AND 1 HASH
 3 SPACES AND 3 HASHES
 2 SPACES AND 5 HASHES
 1 SPACES AND 7 HASHES
 0 SPACE AND 9 HASHES
 
#NEED TO D0

#1. DRECREMENT SPACES BY 1 EACH TIME THROUGH THE LOOP
#2. INCREMENT THE HASHES BY 2 EACH TIME THROUGH THE LOOP
#3. SAVE SPACES TO THE STUMP BY  CALCULATING TREE HEIGHT - 1
#4. DRECREMENT FROM TREE HEIGHT UNTIL IT EQUALS 0
#5. PRINT SPACES AND HASHES FOR EACH ROW
#6. PRINT STUMP SPACES AND THEN 1 HASH
