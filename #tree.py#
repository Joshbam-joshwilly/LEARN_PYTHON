# use 1 while loop and 3 for loops
# 4 spaces : 1 hash
# 3 spaces :  3 hashes
# 2 spaces : 5 hashes
# 1 space : 7 hashes
# 0 spaces : 9 hashes

# need to do
# 1 decrement spaces by 1 each time through the loop
# 2 increment the hashes by 2 each time through the loop
# 3 save spaces to the stump by calculating tree height - 1
# 4 decrement from tree height until it equals 0
# 5 print spaces and then hashes for each row
# 6 print stump spaces and  then 1 hash
